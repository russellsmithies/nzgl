%description
Clustal Omega is the latest addition to the Clustal family. It offers a 
significant increase in scalability over previous versions, allowing hundreds 
of thousands of sequences to be aligned in only a few hours. It will also 
make use of multiple processors, where present. In addition, the quality of 
alignments is superior to previous versions, as measured by a range of 
popular benchmarks.
