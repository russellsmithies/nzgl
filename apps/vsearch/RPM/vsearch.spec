%description
VSEARCH stands for vectorized search, as the tool takes advantage of
parallelism in the form of SIMD vectorization as well as multiple threads to
perform accurate alignments at high speed. VSEARCH uses an optimal global
aligner (full dynamic programming Needleman-Wunsch), in contrast to USEARCH
which by default uses a heuristic seed and extend aligner. This results in more
accurate alignments and overall improved sensitivity (recall) with VSEARCH,
especially for alignments with gaps.

%changelog
* Mon Mar 13 2017 Shane Sturrock <shane.sturrock@nzgenomics.co.nz> - 2.4.2-1
- Default value for fastq_minovlen increased to 16 in accordance with help text
  and for compatibility with usearch. Minor changes for improved accuracy of
  paired-end read merging.

* Thu Mar 02 2017 Shane Sturrock <shane.sturrock@nzgenomics.co.nz> - 2.4.1-1
- This version fixes overflow bugs in fastq_stats and fastq_eestats with very
  large FASTQ files. 
- It also fixes a memory reporting issue on Windows. 
- Minor documentation updates.

  AltiVec) as well as Windows on x86_64. The documentation has been updated and
  a few small bugs have been corrected.

* Wed Dec 14 2016 Shane Sturrock <shane.sturrock@nzgenomics.co.nz> - 2.3.4-1
